# BTB 
**As of right now please only install the binary in Releases and do not git clone. We fixed some bugs and are working on importing them to GitHub.**
BTB (Build The Berg) is a meta-build system designed to work with the Berg build system. 
It reads .berg files and resolves dependencies, building targets in an optimized and transparent way. 
BTB focuses on flexibility, speed, and detailed verbosity for all build operations.
